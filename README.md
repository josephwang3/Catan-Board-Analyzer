# Catan Board Analyzer

This Python project analyzes a Catan board fed in as a .csv file. It calculates statistics such as resource rarity and best starting locations, displaying that data with a Tkinter GUI.

I originally wrote this project as a single script, and later refactored it as practice in Object-Oriented Programming.
